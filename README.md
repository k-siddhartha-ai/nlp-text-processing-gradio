## 🚀 Overview

This project allows users to enter text and observe classical NLP preprocessing steps in real time.

The application performs:

* Word Tokenization
* Sentence Tokenization
* Porter Stemming
* WordNet Lemmatization

The goal is to provide a clear and interactive understanding of fundamental NLP operations before advanced transformer-based models.
